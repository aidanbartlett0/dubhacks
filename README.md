# Goal/Project Description
A website summarizer (UW-focused) to work on easy education and accessibility.

- Scrape UW websites, collect and summarize information into a Mongo DB
    - Web crawler through websites
    - Use perplexity AI ? to process and clean text
- Make an API from Mongo to a website (side track) (React would be so easy)
- Use perplexity AI to interpret a user query based on a prompt (side track)
- then query the Mongo via API
- Return current information to the user

Stretch goals:

- Allow users to put in their own URLs to be scraped and summarized.
- Use Auth0 to ensure users are UW students before they query the UW database. (Sidetrack)
